# What it is/does 
My project is called Hidden Items, where you have to try and find the listed items in the picture within the time limit, but incorrect guesses lose you lives and reduce your timer! There's two modes - levels and infinite, with the levels mode giving you a picture and a ten item list, and the infinite mode looping items continuously in a grid.

# Why I made it
I made the project as it is similar to a game my mum loves to play, and I wanted to see if I could make something similar! I also wanted to improve my CSS/ JavaScript abilities so I could make better games in the future :)

# How I made it
I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make the game, using CSS to stylise the webpages and JavaScript to actually program the images, click detection, timer, etc. I also used Google Slides to create the text images so they would all match my theme.

# What I struggled with and what I learned
I struggled with some of the CSS positioning as the elements would often end up in the wrong place, and it took a while to figure out how to position them so they would stay where they were meant to. Through this, I did learn and improve my CSS knowledge, which will be useful for future projects. I also struggled with the infinite mode, as I had to keep track of the items, positions and indexes. I figured it out in the end though, and the project was fun to make :)
